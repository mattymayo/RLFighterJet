FlightGear
	-Folder with scripts developing our WIP model for autonomous dogfighting
	-FGTelnet.py facilitates communications to flight simulator
	-Hooks.py facilitates Read/Write operations to flight simulator
	-mainA2c.py trains a model using the A2C algorithm
	-mainPPO.py trains a model using the PPO algorithm
	-simulate.py doesn't train a model, instead it loads the env and runs it to demonstrate performance
	/env/
		-FlightGearEnv.py the custom environment that facilitates env manipulation for RL
		-__init__.py blank file just to preserve file structure
		/__pycache__/ cache of python files
	/models/
		-Various folders to store models trained with different algorithms and target reward functions
	/__pycache__/
		Cache of python files
	/tensorboard/
		Stored runs for analysis on training
